# We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.

My name is Risan Bagja Pradana and I code for a living. But this part of the website is where I write anything but programming stuff. I blog about my [daily life](/categories/journal/), my [traveling](/categories/travel/) experiences, and mostly some [random stuff](/categories/writing/) that happened to cross my mind. I occasionally posted some [photos](/categories/photos/) too.
