Hi, my name is Risan Bagja. I code for fun, seriously.

I'm passionate about coding. I enjoy spending time writing clean and maintainable code. I love building stuff. I got the thrills when seeing all of the pieces started to come together and finally working.

I started to code when I was just 14 years old. At that time I was in Junior High School and borrowed a book about Borland Delphi from my relative. I followed and practiced most of the tutorials on that book. I even still remember one of the very first programs I made: a simple rich text editor. Since then, programming became part of my hobbies.

I started to learn about web development in high school. At that time I borrowed a book about HTML and PHP from my friend. Later on, we participated in some website building contest. Luckily enough, we managed to take the first place! It was a custom CMS built using PHP.

I have extensive experience with PHP and JavaScript. For the backend framework, I often choose Laravel. As for the client side, I'm a huge fan of Vue. I'm also comfortable working with the Linux server too. However, I'm not really good at design. Luckily we now have beautiful CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma.
