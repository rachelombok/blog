### background

after a number of setbacks and weeks of waiting, i have finally launched my (first?) podcast! [Huztle]() is a “Gen-Z entrepreneurship podcast, where I interview up and coming GenZ innovators and founders in the field of STEM who have taken initiative to start their own businesses, and gain insight to their journey. They share their experiences, the lessons they’ve learned and their own visions for the future in their respective fields”. this has been a long time in the works.

this past spring semester, i took a podcasting workshop at NYU Tisch School of the Arts as a free elective. i was really only interested in learning about sound design and audio engineering, i’m not a huge podcast person to begin with. but the more the course went on i really enjoyed learning about the different elements of podcasting, and even developed my own show idea, so i figured why not give it a shot after the term is done. 

before this, i had no experience being a content creator at all. additionally, i had no experience in “public speaking” which is an important component of podcasting that can get overlooked. i’ve only listened to podcasts casually through the years, but i was very dead set on creating my own. 

### ideation

the idea for huztle stemmed from my personal taste in podcasts. some of my favorite include [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this), [Building Characters](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/buildingcharacters/id1494981707), [Codeish](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish), [Bytecast](https://acmbytecast.podbean.com/) and [Generation Slay](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/generation-slay/id1459957843). how i built this and bytecast are corporate podcasts in interview format. they interview experts in their field and ask about their professional lives and journeys. codeish and building characters are also corporate podcasts, but the focus more on technologies rather than specific people. it aims more at technically centered topics. generation slay is probably the most similar to my show, but rather than interviewing any genz youth-leader, my show focuses specifically on the ones in the field of STEM.

### release 

over the course of 2-3 months, i crafted the show’s script, intro/outro, trailer and podcast art. the workshop also covered topics such as promotion on social media, and how to create a tone and style within your own show. by the time i was ready to publish this show i already had the rollout plan thought out completely. 

i am so excited that it is finally out, and ready for people to listen to. im also really grateful to Anna, who was so open and welcome to the idea of becoming my first guest. i can’t wait to see where this show goes in the future.

listen to the episode here, or anywhere you get your podcasts.
