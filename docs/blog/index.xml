Huztle is a “Gen-Z entrepreneurship podcast, where I interview up and coming GenZ innovators and founders in the field of STEM who have taken initiative to start their own businesses, and gain insight to their journey. They share their experiences, the lessons they’ve learned and their own visions for the future in their respective fields”.</description>
