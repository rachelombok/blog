    <h1 class='article-title'>Who Made this Website?</h1>Updated on <time datetime='2021-02-15T20:49:00&#43;07:00'>15 February 2021</time><p>My name is Risan Bagja Pradana and I love playing with the computer. I got my first computer when I was in junior high school. At that time, when I was bored playing Flash games, I read a book about Borland Delphi 6. I was hooked and later was able to finish the tutorial by making a simple text editor. I started to publish my software under the pseudonym of RdF, which stands for Reason da Freak‚Äîspells like &ldquo;Risan the Freak&rdquo; (don‚Äôt judge me).</p>
<p>In high school, I joined a computer club. We shared and learned from each other about programming, graphic design, animation, even video editing. I borrowed a book from a friend about PHP and MySQL, and that was the very first time I learned about web programming.</p>
<p>In the second year of high school, our computer club participated in a website building contest. Me, along with the other two friends (<a href="https://twitter.com/rprilian">Rizky</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.halodesigners.com/">Wasil</a>) decided to rebuild our school&rsquo;s website from the scratch. We built our own Content Management System using PHP and MySQL. I vividly remember how we presented our website to the juries. I was confidently talked about how our website was built to prevent attacks from SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and even session hijacking. Luckily enough we managed to take first place. I used the prize money to build a new PC with a shiny AMD Athlon 64-bit processor and a brand-new Radeon graphic card.</p>
<p>In college, I took the Telecommunication Engineering degree. During that time my interest was shifted more towards traveling, books, and writing. I spent my free time reading novels or some traveling books. Daydreaming about vagabonding around the world. I would spend every end of semesters backpacking with friends.</p>
<p>I still love programming. I was always excited to attend a programming course. Did a little bit of C, a bit of Visual Basic, some PHP, and a lot of Java. We even learned about assembly language. Used it to program a decades-old Intel 8085 microprocessor. Even my thesis was programming-related. I built a web-based application to visualize and calculate the budget of a radio microwave link.</p>

<p>Years later, my passion for computer programming is stronger than ever. Now I&rsquo;m writing code for a living. I help my clients to launch their dream website. Sometimes I help startups to ship their million-dollar idea (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fixd-repair">one of them got acquired</a> for tens of millions of dollars in 2019). I work with companies to manage and analyze their data, so they can make better decisions and grow their business.</p>

<p>This website serves as an archive for my thoughts. Sometimes I write about <a href="/code/">programming stuff</a>. But most of the time I blog about my <a href="/categories/journal/">daily life</a>, my <a href="/categories/travel/">traveling</a> experiences, or any <a href="/categories/writing/">random stuff</a> that comes to my mind. I occasionally posted some <a href="/categories/photos/">photos</a> too.</p>
