      <description>I rarely use Python. I only have one repository at Github that is written in Python: iris-flower-classifier. And it was written two years ago!
A few days ago I took this free course from Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning. The machine learning related codes are quite easy to grasp since it simply uses the scikit-learn modules. But most of the supporting Python modules that are provided by this course were like a black-box to me.</description>
